Replaces the Stranger in Black event with Grignr from the Mr Samuel Streamer extended universe. After the events of the RPG Adventure series, Grignr's adventures now continue across trillions of timelines and multitudinous multiverses including yours!

Every shard of Grignr may be subtly different due to the trials and tribulations they have undergone. However all will be Grignr!
